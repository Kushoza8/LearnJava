THIS JAVA FOLDER CONTAINS DEMO OF GENERICS AND LAMBDA EXPRESSION IN JAVA

Lambda expression in java is an anonymous (no name) function that does not need to define the data type of input parameters 
and does not need to have a return type. 
Lambda expression in java implements the functional interface and it can be treated as any other java object.
It can be used to create threads, comparators and can be used to add event Listeners.
Lambda expressions are used with functional interfaces, which are interfaces that have only one abstract method, such as Runnable, Callable, and ActionListener.
